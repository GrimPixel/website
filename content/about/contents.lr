FreeDict is a dictionary project with

*   Truly free dictionaries: everybody is able to use, modify and redistribute
    our  dictionaries, given that the licencing terms are met.
*   Dictionaries can be exported into a variety of output formats for mobile and
    desktop dictionary programs.
*   Dictionaries are independent from a specific format and hence can be made
    available for any purpose, either for end-users or scientific use cases.

The dictionaries are compiled, imported and maintained by enthusiasts in their
spare time. [Learn how to become a part of our community](../community).

### History

This project was started in 2000 by Horst Eyermann. The first databases were
derived from a project called Ergane which used to distribute free dictionaries.
When Michael Bunk took over the project in 2004, he opened the project to a
broader scope, allowing all kinds of dictionaries in the project and converted
all dictionaries into the TEI format. He both imported new dictionaries and wrote other dictionaries by hand himself.

Since then, FreeDict has much evolved
and now offers both imported and hand-crafted dictionaries in various sizes.

With the switch to TEI P5 in 2010, the project uses a
comprehensive standard to encode human speech. This format also allows for the
usage of the dictionaries in yet unforeseen use case scenario's, because it
decouples from the actual output format.

In 2016, FreeDict moved from SourceForge to [Github](https://github.com/freedict). This makes the project more visible and eases collaborative development considerably.
